The use of \"God forbid\" suggests a negative attitude towards Trump. There is also a hint of sarcastic humor towards Trump's alleged narcissism and obsession with hairspray. \n\nStep 2: Determine the relevance of the tweet towards the topic of Hillary Clinton. \n\nAt first glance, the tweet appears to have nothing to do with Hillary Clinton. However, since Clinton was Trump's opponent in the 2016 presidential election, there might be some connection.

It also includes the hashtag #tcot which stands for \"top conservatives on Twitter\" and #UniteBlue which suggests an alignment with the Democratic party. The hashtag #SemST is a reference to semantic analysis and could indicate the author's interest in exploring more deeply the meaning of the tweet or the topic.\n\nStep 2: Consider the context.\n\nGiven that the tweet mentions both Obama and Republicans, it likely refers to a recent political debate or issue related to worker's rights or economic policies.
